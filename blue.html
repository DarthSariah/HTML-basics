      <div>With soft and gentle strokes of fur,<br />Your worries melt away in a purr.<br />A calming presence, a soothing balm,<br />A cat can be the perfect cuddle charm.</div>
      <div>They'll keep you company in the quiet of night,<br />Curled up beside you, oh so tight.<br />Their gentle breathing a lullaby,<br />That can ease your mind and help you fly.</div>
      <div>With playful antics and curious minds,<br />Cats can be the perfect way to unwind.<br />They'll chase a toy or bat a string,<br />And fill your heart with joy that will always ring.</div>
