          Another very famous cat is <b>Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office</b>.
          You may be wondering what that is supposed to be.. Well, Chief Mouser
          to the Cabinet Office is the title of the official resident cat at 10
          Downing Street, the residence and executive office of the prime
          minister of the United Kingdom in London. There has been a resident
          cat in the British government employed as a mouser and pet since the
          16th century, although modern records date only to the 1920s. Despite
          other cats having served Downing Street, the first one to be given the
          official title of Chief Mouser by the British government was Larry in
          2011. Other cats have been given this title affectionately, usually by
          the British press.
