/* Change inline-flex to just flex so you don't have issues with width in larger screens */
/* https://prnt.sc/bx4ZC2b_6Moy */
/* Both inline-flex and flex will make the element a flexbox container that we will see later on what it is */
/* But if you put inline in front means just that. It is inline instead of block (its like span instead of div) */
/* So beeing inline means it will take only as much width as it needs to fill the space and not all the width */
