/* Selectors can be 1 of 3 things. */
/* 1. Element selector (ex. p) */
/* 2. Class selector (ex. .make-red) */
/* 3. ID selector (ex. #navigation-top) */

/* Differnces between Class selectors and ID selectors */
/* 1. Class selectors can be used on multiple elements */
/* 1.1 When defining a class we add a dot (.) before the name */
/* 2. ID selectors can only be used on one element */
/* 2.1 When defining an ID we add a hash (#) before the name */

.make-purple {

.make-red {

/* Naming classes and IDs should use a method called snake-case */
/* Snake-case is when you use dashes to separate words and everything is lowercase */
/* Example: .this-is-a-class */

/* We have one last selector that is more advanced callsed pseudo-selector */
/* Pseudo-selectors are used to select elements based on a state */
/* What is a state? */
/* A state is when an element is in a certain condition, like on hover, clicked, active, etc... */

/* Ex. */
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}

/* We want to target the hover state by adding a semicolon (:) after the classname (or another selector)(.box) */
/* Then we add the pseudo-selector (hover) */

.box:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}

/* Some other basic states we may have are: */
/* :focus */
/* :visited */
